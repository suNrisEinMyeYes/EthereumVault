Choosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to, but also incurs some mild to moderate costs for you. Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages:**

-   Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks    
-   Authoritatively validates all transactions
-   Can interact with any contract on the public blockchain without an intermediary
-   Can directly deploy contracts into the public blockchain without an intermediary
-   Can query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline
-   Can query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you’re reading

**Disadvantages:**

-   Requires significant and growing hardware and bandwidth resources
-   May require several days to fully sync when first started
-   Must be maintained, upgraded, and kept online to remain synced
