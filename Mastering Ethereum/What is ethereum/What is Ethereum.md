# What is Ethereum?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From a computer science perspective, Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From a more practical perspective, Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called _smart contracts_. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the systemâ€™s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called _ether_ to meter and constrain execution resource costs.</p>
